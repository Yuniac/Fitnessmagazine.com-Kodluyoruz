## Kodluyoruz First week assignment.

### I used HTML/CSS only, the few fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), icons from [Icons DB](https://www.iconsdb.com/), images are from the [template](https://dribbble.com/shots/8502411-Fitnessmagazine-com-Article-Page/attachments/793527?mode=media) which I attempted to duplicate, the background image is from [Unspalsh](https://unsplash.com/)
 
### Technologies used: HTML semantics elements, CSS varibales, flex and grid.
